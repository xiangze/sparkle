  RV32 EX/WB abort guarantee — sequential invariant (LTL)

  This is the first **sequential** (time-stepping) proof in the
  decomposition effort, building on the pure helpers extracted
  in commits 40f51e5 ... a70d809.

  Goal: when `suppressEXWB` fires at cycle t, the corresponding
  EXWB control bits are all `false` at cycle t+1, so the in-flight
  IDEX instruction does not commit.

  This is the cornerstone of trap correctness: every trap-related
  fix in the recent commits (568bb68, 0e14494, 019dbcb, 01c7177)
  rests on this property holding.

  We use the `register` primitive's semantics directly:

      (Signal.register init input).val 0       = init
      (Signal.register init input).val (n + 1) = input.val n

  Combined with the latch expression in the loop body
  (`mux suppressEXWB false idex_regWrite`), the next-cycle property
  follows by case analysis on `suppressEXWB.val t`.

## The latched EXWB control bit, modeled as a Signal

  `exwbRegWNextSignal` — the value driving the EXWB regWrite latch's
  input. This is exactly the expression
  `mux suppressEXWB false idex_regWrite` from `SoC.lean` (line 1594).

## The abort guarantee — sequential invariant

  **Abort guarantee for register write.**

  If `suppressEXWB` is asserted at cycle `t`, the EXWB regWrite latch
  is `false` at cycle `t+1`. Equivalently: a suppressed instruction's
  register write is dropped, exactly one cycle later.

  This is invariant E0 from the proof effort: the smallest sequential
  property we need to certify trap correctness. -/

## Generalising to all gated EXWB control bits

  The same pattern applies to `exwb_m2r`, `exwb_jump`, `exwb_isCsr`,
  `prevStoreEn` (memWrite), and `exwb_isAMO`. They all use
  `Signal.mux suppressEXWB (Signal.pure false) idex_*` for next-state.

  We package this generically: any latch driven by
  `mux suppressEXWB false x` is `false` one cycle after `suppressEXWB`. -/

    `mux suppressEXWB false x` produces `false` at cycle t+1 when
    `suppressEXWB` is asserted at cycle t. -/

/-- **idex_regWrite at cycle t = false → exwbRegWSignal at t+1 = false.**

    If the IDEX-stage source bit is already false, the next-cycle
    EXWB latch is false regardless of suppressEXWB. This is the
    "downstream" half of the cycle-N+2 trap-suppression chain:
    after trap at N, IDEX is squashed at N+1 (idex_regWrite=false),
    so by this lemma exwb_regW at N+2 is also false. -/

## DRAM-write non-suppression — the open suspect, made formal

The peripheral writes (CLINT/MMIO/UART) all gate on `validEX`:

    clintWE = idex_memWrite ∧ isCLINT_ex ∧ validEX
    mmioWE  = idex_memWrite ∧ is_mmio_ex ∧ validEX
    uartWE  = idex_memWrite ∧ isUART_ex ∧ validEX

The DRAM write does NOT:

    dmem_we = idex_memWrite ∧ isDMEM_ex ∧ ¬dTLBMiss ∧ ¬scExFails

The next theorem makes this asymmetry **machine-checked**: it
constructs a concrete witness state where `suppressEXWB = true` but
`dmem_we = true`. Such a state is unreachable for the suppressors
that imply `freezeIDEX` (e.g. `pendingWriteEn`, `mmuBusy`) because
those also block `idex_memWrite` from updating — but it IS reachable
for `trap_taken` and `dMMURedirect`, which do not freeze IDEX. -/

/-- The DRAM `dmem_we` expression as a pure function of its
    five Bool inputs. -/

    (idex_memWrite isDMEM_ex dTLBMiss scExFails : Bool) : Bool :=

/--
  Witness theorem: there exist states where `suppressEXWB = true`
  (specifically: `trap_taken = true`) AND `dmem_we = true` (a normal
  DMEM store is in IDEX with no TLB miss and no SC fail). This means
  the DRAM write commits even though every other side-effect-bearing
  EXWB control bit is suppressed.

  This is the **smoking-gun asymmetry** that the residual Linux boot
  bug is suspected to expose. Proving this theorem here doesn't fix
  the bug — it formalises the gap so any future change must address
  it explicitly. -/

## Connection to invariant E

This file establishes the **single-cycle abort guarantee**: when
`suppressEXWB` fires, every gated EXWB control bit is dropped one
cycle later.

The full invariant E (`docs/RV32_Architecture_Status.md` §2.2)
adds two more pieces, both still TODO:

  E1. **Re-execution after sret**: when mepc points back to the
      suppressed instruction's PC, that instruction re-fetches and
      re-executes with stable inputs (regfile values are the same as
      pre-trap because trap entry/exit save/restore them).

  E2. **DRAM-write asymmetry**: the DRAM `dmem_we` does NOT use
      `validEX` gating, so a store in IDEX during a trap commits to
      DRAM even though `suppressEXWB` would otherwise drop it. This
      is the open question that motivated this file.

E1 requires modeling the trap save/restore sequence (kernel ABI).
E2 requires showing the dmem_we's actual gating is sufficient — i.e.
either prove the double-commit is benign (idempotent) or prove the
gating is missing (the latter would be the long-suspected bug).

Both are larger proofs and depend on this single-cycle abort
guarantee as a building block. -/
